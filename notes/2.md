create a tarball:
```zsh
echo "File 1 contents" >> file1.txt
echo "File 2 contents" >> file2.txt
echo "File 3 contents" >> file3.txt
tar -cf files.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

# dump a tarball as hex  

- open the file in binary mode
- read it in
- dump the contents to standard out as hex

# xxd output format

- 3 sections
- first is the offset into the file 
- second is the data as hex
