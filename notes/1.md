`xxd`:
- unix command line tool to create hexdumps 
- convert a hexdump back into its binary form 
- useful if you want to dig into binary files 
- display info in hexadecimal and ASCII format...

`hexadecimal`:
- base of 16 (instead of base of 10 (decimal))
- 0-9 represent 0-9
- A-F (or a-f) to represent values from 10-15
- 0 based 
- used by software engineers because they provide human friendly representations of binary-coded values
- each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits)  

Example:
- in binary, a byte (8 bits) can range from 00000000 to 11111111
- in decimal, this is 0 to 255
- in hexadecimal this is 00 to FF

`8 bit byte`:
- 8 bits
- each bit = 0 or 1
- 2^8 possible combinations (for 8 bits)
- oh this is just another way of saying "byte"

`2,932` in decimal can be presented as `B74_16` in hexadecimal as 
- 1174_16... ?
- 

How to convert 2932 to hexadecimal?
- divide 2932/16 = 183 with remainder of 4
- divide the quotient (183) by 16 = 11 with a remainder of 7
- divide quotient (11) by 16 = 0 with remainder of 11 
- read remainders in reverse order!
- B74

`Base16`:
- each byte of the plaintext is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits  

decimal <-> byte <-> hexadecimal <-> ASCII code ...
